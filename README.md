# Portfolio-AWS
Built a fully automated, serverless ETL data pipeline on AWS using S3, AWS Glue (Crawlers, Jobs, Triggers, Scheduler), and Athena. CloudFormation was used to deploy the infrastructure. The pipeline processes CSV data and stores transformed output back in S3 for querying with Athena.
